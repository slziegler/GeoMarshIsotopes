**Abstract:** As consumers and resources move across ecological boundaries, spatial energy subsidies from one ecosystem can enhance the secondary production of another. In coastal systems, marsh primary production is thought to bolster estuarine and marine food webs, enhancing the secondary production of mobile fishes and crustaceans through spatial processes such as trophic relay. Previous studies have indicated that the amount of marsh primary production contributing to the diets of small marsh-associated taxa varies greatly from the Gulf of Mexico to Chesapeake Bay and is driven by tidal dynamics. To determine the role of marsh-derived energy for mobile estuarine consumers over large spatial scales, we conducted bulk stable isotope analyses across four geographically distinct sites (13º latitude): across Louisiana, North Carolina, New Jersey, and Massachusetts USA. Our results revealed mobile estuarine consumers from our northern sites tended to have equivalent or larger contributions of marsh-derived carbon (11-38% along Atlantic coast) compared to our southern site (11%-23% along Gulf of Mexico). However, we found no difference in trophic transfer efficiency of marsh-derived production across sites. As a whole, our results indicate that the magnitude of marsh energy subsidies to estuarine consumers varies across sites and highlights the importance of examining these patterns across large spatial scales to disentangle the mechanistic drivers of energy flow dynamics.
